title: Loader usage
description: Let's see how to use our loader
---
import {
  Tabs, TabItem, Code, LinkCard, FileTree
} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The usage is extremely simple, here we will show you how to use it, regardless of whether it is TypeScript or JavaScript.

```js copy wrap twoslash showLineNumbers
import { Loader } from "@vimn/uncmd"
// ---cut---
const loader = new Loader({
  /**
   * Here are the file extensions of your commands, for example: “ts”, “js”, “cjs” or “mjs”.
   * It is not necessary to specify all those files, actually just use the same extension as your index.
  */
	extensions: [ /* File extensions */ ],
	path: './commands',
	bot: {
		id: process.env['BOT_ID'],
		token: process.env['BOT_TOKEN']
	}
});
```

This is included in your index, in a function, or wherever, as long as the file containing this is executed, everything will work.
So as you may have noticed, you can use this code whatever you use, whether it is a `.ts`, `.js`, `.cjs` or `.mjs` file.

## Example of your files
Suppose I put this in the index, now, your files should look something like this:

(Remember to choose the example based on whether you are using JavaScript or TypeScript)
<Tabs syncKey="language-select">
  <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
<FileTree>
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- src
  - index.ts
  - commands
    - ...
</FileTree>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">
<FileTree>
- package.json
- src
  - index.js
  - commands
    - ...
</FileTree>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
