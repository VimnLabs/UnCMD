import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Reasons
<Steps>
1. **Universal compatibility:**
Works seamlessly with any Discord library, allowing developers to integrate it no matter what technology they use. Even regardless of whether you use TypeScript or JavaScript.

2. **Easy initialization:**
Focusing on simplicity, it is easy to set up and use.

3. **Optimized development time:**
By handling both prefix and slash commands in a single implementation, the time and effort required to develop and maintain separate commands is significantly reduced.

4. **Ease of maintenance:**
With a unified structure for both types of commands, the code is cleaner and easier to maintain, facilitating future updates and enhancements.

5. **Community and support:**
By supporting multiple libraries and command styles, it is more likely to be adopted by a diverse community of developers, which can translate into greater support, contributions and resource sharing.
